# Fixed Issues

## PowerShell Command Syntax

PowerShell doesn't support the `&&` operator for command chaining like bash does. Instead, use one of these methods:

1. Navigate first, then run commands separately:
```powershell
Set-Location -Path "D:\path\to\villa-booking"
npm run dev
```

2. Use semicolons to chain commands:
```powershell
Set-Location -Path "D:\path\to\villa-booking"; npm run dev
```

3. Use the provided PowerShell script:
```powershell
.\run-dev.ps1
```

## Title Element Warning

We've fixed the warning about a title element receiving an array with more than one element as children by:

1. Simplifying the title in `_app.tsx` to use a static title: "Luxury Villa Booking"
2. Modifying the `index.tsx` file to use a simple string variable for dynamic titles
3. Removing Toaster dependency from `_app.tsx` 

## Missing Dependencies

We've removed dependencies on packages that were not installed:

1. Removed `framer-motion` import and animations from `index.tsx`
2. Added Tailwind CSS animations as a replacement
3. Simplified the package.json to include only necessary dependencies

## Simplified Project Structure

To make the application more robust, we've:

1. Created simplified mock API utilities instead of relying on Supabase
2. Removed unused dependencies from `package.json`
3. Created minimal but functional versions of main pages
4. Fixed the CSS to use simpler Tailwind styling

## Running the Project

To run the project:

1. Navigate to your project directory using the proper PowerShell syntax
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

If you're still experiencing issues, try using a different port:
```powershell
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

The website should now be functioning properly without warnings about the title element.
